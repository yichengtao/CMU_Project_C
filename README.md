# CMU_Project_C
My most significant C programming project for CMU application.

This is a homework assignment of the Brandeis course COSI 130A: Introduction to the Theory of Computation. The C program TaoYicheng.c is a program that can print itself. Run TaoYicheng.c and the sample output is like:

Hello
***********

The program (codes) itself

***********
Goodbye

See Output.txt for details.
The size of the whole project is 31 lines.
